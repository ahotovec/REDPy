# REDPy has moved!

After over a year of concentrated development work and many hurdles overcome, REDPy has moved to its new home as official U.S. Geological Survey software at [**https://code.usgs.gov/vsc/REDPy/**](https://code.usgs.gov/vsc/REDPy/).

I did a lot of work under the hood to make it more efficient, and I have many plans to add more features in the coming years.

_**All future development will be hosted in the new repository and this repository will no longer be updated.**_

New users should download the [latest version](https://code.usgs.gov/vsc/REDPy/-/releases), and read the [updated Wiki](https://code.usgs.gov/vsc/REDPy/-/wikis/home) for documentation.

A snapshot of the last commit in this repository with an intact `README.md` file is available [here](https://github.com/ahotovec/REDPy/releases/) for posterity as "Version 0" of the code. I will no longer be supporting users of Version 0, but I am happy to help you migrate to the new one.
